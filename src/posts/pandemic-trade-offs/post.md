This webpage allows you to compare COVID-19 policy responses (e.g. vaccination coverage and effectiveness, impacts of lockdowns on conditions other than SARS-CoV-2 infection rates).  We have run 600+ scenarios, 100 iterations each, through an agent-based model to estimate SARS-CoV-2 infection rates, then run each of these scenarios and iterations through an integrated epidemiological and economic model to estimate health loss (in health adjusted life years; HALYs; coming soon), health expenditure and GDP costs â€“ with the proportion of times each scenario is optimal from either a health or partial societal perspective (including GDP).

Introduce the research.

List side-effects of restrictions, to make concrete. Both negative and positive. Lost revenue, unemployment, depression, anxiety, suicide, domestic violence, alcohol consumption, road traffic crashes, work-life balance, lost education, deferred medical treatment / screening, family time, access to green space, ...

## Case numbers by strategy

Add vaccine phases to graph.

## Unintended consequences

#### HALYS/DALYS

Briefly describe which consequences are included.

Introduce the concept of HALYs/DALYs, and how they are estimated.

#### Thorny Questions

- What monetary value should be placed on a HALY?

#### Important considerations

- Regardless of policy response, there is still a pandemic. Need to compare each scenario to other ways of responding to the pandemic, not to the pre-pandemic world.

## Limitations

- Difficulty in estimating impacts of different restriction levels.
- This is just one way of approaching decision-making. Implies a particular ethical framework (\~utilitarianism), which may not be correct.
